<!-- 
This is a script tag with type "module", which indicates that the file being imported (Knight-Hit-Test.js) is an ES module.
The import statement at the beginning is used to import the App class from the file './Knight-Hit-Test.js'. 
This class is likely defined in that file and is being used to create a new instance of the app.
The DOMContentLoaded event listener is added to ensure that the code inside the function only runs once the HTML document has finished loading.
Inside the event listener function, a new instance of the App class is created and assigned to the app variable. 
The window.app = app line assigns the app instance to the global window object, which allows it to be accessed from other parts of the code.
