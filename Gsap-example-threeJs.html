<!-- 
This is an HTML file that contains a simple user interface for a GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) animation example that uses the Three.js library. 
The interface includes three input fields for the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively, and a play button. 
When the user enters numerical values for the coordinates and clicks on the play button, an animation will be triggered using GSAP and Three.js, 
which will move a 3D object in a web browser window according to the specified coordinates. The code includes links to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files, 
including the GSAP library and the Three.js library (which is currently commented out).
